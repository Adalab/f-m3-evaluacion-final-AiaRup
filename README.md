# Aia Rupsom - fairfax-m3-evaluacion-final

This is an app that I prepared in the final exam on module 3, as part of the ADALAB course for training Front-End developers. This app consists of a web page with a list of Harry Potter characters,
where you can filter by the character's name. The characters info is taken from this [API](https://hpâ€’api.herokuapp.com/).

## Quick Start Guide

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Install local dependencies with \$ npm install

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

```
